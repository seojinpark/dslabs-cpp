#  Distributed Systems Labs in C++

MIT 6.824 style distributed systems lab rebuilt in C++.
It includes a series of labs in which you will build a transactional, sharded, fault-tolerant key/value storage system (like Google Spanner, MongoDB, etc). 

# Acknowledgment

Orignally authored by Shuai Mu and Julie Lee. It was inspired by MIT 6.824, and the code is based on the academic prototypes of previous research works, including Rococo/Janus/Snow/DRP/Rolis/DepFast.
